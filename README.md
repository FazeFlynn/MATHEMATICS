# The Vector Space Rules
## Group 1️⃣: Rules that make addition behave sensibly (5 rules)

These ensure **vector addition behaves like normal addition**.

### 1. Closure under addition

If **${v}$** and **${w}$** are in the space, then **${v + w}$** is also in the space

📌 Without this: adding vectors could throw you outside the universe.

---

### 2. Commutativity

$$
{v + w = w + v}
$$

📌 Direction shouldn’t depend on order.

---

### 3. Associativity

$$
{(v + w) + u = v + (w + u)}
$$

📌 Grouping shouldn’t change meaning.

---

### 4. Additive identity (zero vector)

$$
{v + 0 = v}
$$

📌 There must be a “do nothing” vector.

---

### 5. Additive inverse

$$
{v + (−v) = 0}
$$

📌 Every move must be undoable.

---

## Group 2️⃣: Rules that make scaling behave sensibly (4 rules)

These ensure **scalars interact cleanly with vectors**.

### 6. Closure under scalar multiplication

${αv}$ is in the space for any scalar ${α}$

📌 Otherwise scaling could destroy structure.

---

### 7. Distributivity over vector addition

$$
{α(v + w) = αv + αw}
$$

📌 Scaling a sum should match summing scaled parts.

---

### 8. Distributivity over scalar addition

$$
{(α + β)v = αv + βv}
$$

📌 Multiple scalings should combine logically.

---

### 9. Associativity of scalar multiplication

$$
{α(βv) = (αβ)v}
$$

📌 Scaling order must not matter.

---

## Group 3️⃣: Rule that links vectors to numbers (1 rule)

### 🔟 Scalar identity

$$
{1 · v = v}
$$

📌 Multiplying by “one” should change nothing.

# Linear Transformation Rules


## 1️⃣ Rule 1: Additivity (preserve addition)

$$
\boxed{T(v + w) = T(v) + T(w)}
$$

Meaning:

Transforming $$
{a}$ sum = summing the transform
s$

---

##  2️⃣ Rule 2: Homogeneity (preserve scaling)

$$
\boxed{T(\alpha v) = \alpha T(v)}
$$

Meaning:

Scaling first or transforming first gives the same result
